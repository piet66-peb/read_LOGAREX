# read_LOGAREX

is a sample script, a Linux bash script that shows how to easily read data 
from an electric meter via an infrared interface and send it to a round-robin 
database and/or a Z-Way virtual device.

This example is made for the special meter LOGAREX LK13BD102015. It should be possible to adapt 
the script to many other meters without much effort.

This script
- either stores data into a local round-robin database using RRDtool-commands.
- or stores data into a remote round-robin database using RRDTool_API.
- and forwards data to a Z-Way virtual device using Curl.

RRDtool is not only a database software, it also provides a graphing function. It could look like this:

## Requirements

An electric meter with an infrared interface using the standard IEC 62056-21 with printable output for data exchange, a USB infrared optohead cable, 
and a Linux system with bash.
No other software is needed to read the meter.

## Installation

* Prepare the electric meter for data transmission.
* Connect the meter via an optohead cable with a USB port of your system.
* Find the used Linux device name (for example with **ls /dev/ttyUSB\***).
* Add a udev rule for this serial infrared device (see below). This rule creates a 
descriptive name for the serial interface, independently of the currently used 
physical USB port, and adds the necessary rights for the user.
* Put the packet on any place of your choice. 
* Adapt the script **read_LOGAREX.bash** and may be **store_zway.bash** to your needs.
* Adjust the settings in the **./settings** file to your requirements.
* Run the script **00_install_read_LOGAREX.bash**
* Start the **read_LOGAREX.bash** script.

#### UDEV Rule

As root add a new line to file **/etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules**:
<br>
**SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="VVV", ATTRS{idProduct}=="PPP", 
ATTRS{serial}=="SSS", SYMLINK+="LLL", OWNER="OOO"**
<br>with: 
<br>VVV = vendor id
<br>PPP = product id
<br>SSS = serial number
<br>LLL = new device link /dev/LLL to create
<br>OOO = owner (= $USER)
<br>and run 
<br>**sudo udevadm control --reload-rules**
<br>**sudo udevadm trigger**
<br>**ls -l /dev/LLL**<br>to take the change into effect.
<br><br>
These data can be found with the commands:
<br>**udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyUSB\<n>| grep '{idVendor}' | head -n1**
<br>**udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyUSB\<n> | grep '{idProduct}' | head -n1**
<br>**udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyUSB\<n> | grep '{serial}' | head -n1**
<br>with  /dev/ttyUSB\<n> = your currently used USB port.

## Settings

Important settings (file **./settings**):
* the logical name of the meter device
* data for the rrd database access

## Start - Stop the Script read_LOGAREX.bash

To get the commands run the script **11_get_procid.bash**.

## Uninstallation

* Stop the script **read_LOGAREX.bash**.
* Remove the udev rule.
* Run the script **99_do_removes.bash**.
* Delete the packet folder.
